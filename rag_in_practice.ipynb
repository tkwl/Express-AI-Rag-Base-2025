He argued that by spending time alone in nature, individuals could escape the distractions and superficialities of modern life, and instead, focus on their inner lives and connect with the natural world.\\n\\nThoreau wrote, \"I never found a companion that was so companionable as solitude.\" He believed that solitude allowed him to think more deeply, to observe the world around him more closely, and to cultivate a sense of inner peace and contentment. He also saw solitude as a means of simplifying one\\'s life, of stripping away unnecessary distractions and focusing on what was truly essential.\\n\\nIn \"Walden,\" Thoreau described his experience of living alone in a cabin near Walden Pond, where he spent two years, two months, and two days in solitude. During this time, he kept a journal, observed the natural world, and reflected on his own life and values. He wrote, \"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\"\\n\\nThoreau\\'s emphasis on the importance of solitude has inspired many people to reevaluate their priorities and seek out time for quiet reflection and contemplation.

       "'Based on the provided context, here\\'s a comparison of Da Vinci and Thoreau\\'s thoughts on perception/seeing:\\n\\nDa Vinci\\'s quotes suggest that he believed perception and seeing are closely tied to the functioning of the eye and the process of observation. He stated that \"Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a thorough knowledge of the function of the eye\" and \"All our knowledge has its origin in our perceptions.\" He also wondered about the difference in clarity between dreams and wakeful imagination, implying an interest in the mechanisms of perception.\\n\\nThoreau, on the other hand, took a more philosophical approach, saying \"It\\'s not what you look at that matters, it\\'s what you see.\" This quote implies that Thoreau believed seeing is not just a physical act, but also a mental and interpretive one.\\n\\nIn contrast to Da Vinci\\'s focus on the physical aspects of perception, Thoreau\\'s quote suggests that the meaning and significance we derive from what we see are more important than the mere act of looking. While Da Vinci seemed to be interested in the technical and scientific aspects of perception, Thoreau\\'s thought is more concerned with the subjective and interpretive nature of seeing.'"
